When you finish writing code in this file, StoneMasonKarel should 
solve the "repair the quad" problem from Assignment 1. You
should make sure that your program works for all of the 
sample worlds supplied in the starter folder.

NOTE: I noticed that in all the sample worlds given in this problem, 
the distance between quads is three corners away, so I made used of that to write my 
program easily.
